# scVAE: Supervised Contrastive Variational Autoencoder

## Overview
This repository contains the Python implementation of scVAE, a novel deep learning model that combines contrastive and supervised learning methods into the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework. scVAE is designed to learn salient representations from data.

## Features
- Implementation of scVAE model architecture
- Training and evaluation scripts

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.6
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy


## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Boyu-J/Supervised_Contrastive_VAE.git
```

Install the required dependencies in requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Train scVAE model on your dataset using the provided scripts.
2. Utilize the trained scVAE model for various downstream tasks.
3. Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures to customize scVAE for your specific application.
